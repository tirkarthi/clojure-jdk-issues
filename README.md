# clojure-jdk-issues

The [issues](../../issues) on this repository are intended to be a central list of
issues that Clojure libraries have with latest Clojure and JDK.

If you know of/run into a problem with a Clojure library that you
think is caused by changes in Clojure or JDK, please file an issue with the
library, and link to it from an existing issue here, or create a new
one, as appropriate.

This project was inspired by : https://github.com/tobias/clojure-java-9

TODO : 

Create appropriate Clojure and JDK tags for the issues for filtering
